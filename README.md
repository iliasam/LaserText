Main parts of it are: polygon mirror module, laser, BLDC motor from DVD with glued mirror, MCU board, photosensor, bread board, ULN2003.

MCU board is Blue Pill (STM32F103C8T6).

Laser - any suitable diode laser (from laser pointer (weak) or from DVD - powerful, but dangerous for eyes).

Polygon mirror module (from laser printer) - I think that every one that you can run is suitable.
